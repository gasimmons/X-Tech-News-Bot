# X-Tech-News-Bot
This is a X (Formerly Twitter) bot that will be tasked with reposting any significant technological news updates. I am creating this to explore the abillity of bots, starting with the most basic version of a bot that can interact with others on twitter, to hopefully using AI that is unrecognizable from a real user. This leads to another interest of mine, introduced to me in the Lex Friedman podcast episode featuring Andrej Karpathy in which they discussed the idea of some sort of token needed to distinguish human from AI in an online space.

Some of the challenges I forsee in the first part of the project is most importantly figuring out what should and shouldn't be significant news worthy of a post, what are reliable and trustworthy sources to gain this knowledge from, and how to prevent from posting the same thing topic repeatedly if for example it is trending and there are many posts related.

I think initially it should work by just reposting credible sources, but in the future it would be cool to use AI to allow it to maybe summarize its findings, and interact with the audience if it manages to create one.
